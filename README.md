# Pulse Chat

Pulse Chat is a lightweight, real-time chat application designed for small teams and communities. This repository contains a full-stack implementation (React + TypeScript frontend, Node.js + Express backend, WebSocket real-time transport) with an admin monitoring panel, media uploads, and production-focused deployment workflows.

This README documents the project architecture, setup, environment variables, deployment, security considerations, and a progress log describing the improvements and bug fixes made during development.

## Project overview

Pulse Chat is a real-time chat application that supports text, images, video, GIFs, reactions, message editing, delete-for-everyone, and an admin monitoring interface. The design emphasizes: reliability, predictable mobile UX, secure admin access, and clear operational deployment steps.

The repository is organized with a frontend React app (TypeScript) under `frontend/` and the backend Node/Express server under `backend/`.

## Technology stack

- Frontend: React (TypeScript), styled-components, react-scripts
- Real-time: WebSockets (`ws`) between clients and server
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose (MongoDB Atlas)
- Storage for uploads: Cloudinary
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions; frontend typically deployed to Netlify, backend to Azure App Service
- Other: dotenv for config, multer for upload handling

## Architecture and key components

- `frontend/` — React single-page app. Main entry is `src/index.tsx`, chat UI in `src/Chat.tsx`, and admin client under `src/Admin.tsx`.
- `backend/` — Express API and WebSocket server. Primary server code is `backend/index.js`. Persistent data models live in `backend/models/`.
- Realtime: The server keeps a WS feed for live updates consumed by the admin panel and clients.
- Media: Uploads are forwarded to Cloudinary and references (URLs) are stored in MongoDB.

## Quick start (development)

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+ (or current LTS)
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas connection string (or a local MongoDB)
- Cloudinary account credentials if enabling media uploads

Steps (frontend and backend in parallel)

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/pulse-chat-app.git
cd "Pulse Chat repo root"
```

2. Backend (in a terminal):

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
# create a .env with required variables (see below)
npm run dev
# or: node index.js
```

3. Frontend (in another terminal):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend dev server will proxy API requests to the backend if configured (see `REACT_APP_API_URL`).

## Production build & deploy

Build frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Build/deploy backend according to your chosen host. This project uses GitHub Actions to push built artifacts and (for the backend) update Azure App Service app settings for production environment variables. See `.github/workflows/` for action definitions.

## Environment variables

The app relies on a few environment variables; do NOT commit `.env` files. Examples:

Backend `.env` (required in production):

- `PORT` (optional) — port for Express server
- `MONGODB_URI` — MongoDB connection string
- `CLIENT_PASSWORD` — client login password (moved to backend verification)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` — admin panel password (kept secret, not in front-end)
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` — if using Cloudinary
- `TENOR_API_KEY` — if GIF search is integrated

Frontend `.env` (only flags/URLs):

- `REACT_APP_API_URL` — optional API base url (defaults to same-origin)

Production deployment note: set these variables in Azure App Settings / Netlify environment settings or via GitHub Secrets used by the workflow.

## Security notes

- Secrets and passwords were removed from the frontend code. Admin authentication occurs via a secure backend `POST /api/auth/verify` endpoint and the admin WebSocket handshake uses an in-message handshake (not query parameters) to avoid leaking secrets.
- DO NOT commit `.env` files or secrets to Git.
- The repo includes a `.gitignore` entry for `frontend/old_chats/` (local notes) to prevent accidental push.

## Admin panel

The admin panel provides:

- Real-time message logs
- Live activity feed
- Server logs viewer
- Online user list

Admin access is password-protected. The admin client uses WebSockets to receive live updates; the server pushes events whenever messages or user-connection state change.

## UX & behavior details (notable implementations)

- Mobile-first UX improvements: careful handling of on-screen keyboard, `Enter` behavior set to insert new line on mobile, keyboard not minimized when tapping the “scroll-to-bottom” control.
- **2026-03-02 update:**
  - Emoji picker now opens and keyboard closes in a single tap on mobile, with no focus-jank or two-tap issues.
  - Keyboard minimization is now smooth on all keyboards except Gboard (which has a known Android bug outside app control).
  - Checkbox selection in select mode now works reliably on the first tap on mobile (no double-tap needed).
- Overlay/back-button behavior: mobile back button closes overlays in a strict hierarchy (delete modal → select mode → lightbox → user list) rather than exiting the app.
- Selection mode: synchronous guard push into history to avoid race conditions when enabling message-select mode.
- Copy behavior: the footer `Copy` action is mobile-only and appears only when exactly one message is selected; it hides when multiple messages are selected.
- Media interaction: tapping an image/video/GIF preview opens the lightbox/player without selecting the message; selecting a message still works when tapping the side-area or for plain text/quoted messages.

## Testing & CI

- The project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy. Workflows include steps to push app settings to Azure when deploying the backend.
- Recommended: add a Playwright or Puppeteer test suite to assert mobile behaviors (keyboard, copy button visibility, double-click quoting behavior) where needed.

## Troubleshooting

- If the backend fails to start on Azure, check that all required env vars (notably `MONGODB_URI`) are present in App Settings.
- If the admin login fails in production, ensure `CLIENT_PASSWORD` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set as production app settings / GitHub Secrets used by the workflow.

## Changelog / Project Progress (Session summaries)

This project progressed through multiple focused sessions. Brief highlights by session:

- Session 1: Security cleanup — removed hardcoded client/admin passwords, moved verification to backend.
- Session 2: Admin panel converted to real-time via WebSockets and bug fixes to live activity.
- Session 3: Integrated MongoDB Atlas and persisted messages and events.
- Session 4: Refinement for deployment readiness; removed unused features and improved environment abstraction.
- Session 5: Production stability — CI changes to avoid backend crash loops and persistent user identity fixes.
- Session 6: UX — added "Scroll to Bottom" button, fixed scroll-on-refresh, and build stability fixes.
- Session 7: Advanced mobile UX fixes — refined scroll button and resolved mobile reaction/select conflicts.
- Session 8: Final stability — fixed reaction-related crashes and polished mobile gestures.
- Session 9: Deployment and UX polishing; fixed Netlify/CI related issues.
- Session 10: Styling and build fixes; finalized system message styling and TypeScript issues.
- Session 11: Advanced UX: delete-for-everyone, hierarchical mobile back button behavior, presence debouncing.
- Session 12: Security hardening, UX polish and production push.
  - Footer copy: mobile `Copy` action appears only when exactly one message selected.
  - Media preview taps: tapping image/video/GIF opens lightbox/player without selecting message; selection occurs from side-area taps or text taps.

- Session 13: Mobile Keyboard & Emoji UX Polish.
- Fixed emoji picker so that tapping the emoji button while the keyboard is open now closes the keyboard and opens the emoji picker in a single, smooth action (no more two-tap or focus-jank issues).
- Improved keyboard minimization smoothness on all mobile keyboards by avoiding focus/blur fights and deferring menu-closing logic.
- Checkbox selection in select mode now works reliably on the first tap on mobile (no double-tap needed).
- Noted that the only remaining minor stutter (Gboard top bar briefly sticking) is a Gboard-specific issue, not caused by the app. All other keyboards minimize flawlessly.

If you want, I can also:

- Add a short `Makefile` or `npm` scripts to streamline environment setup.
- Generate a `deployment.md` with step-by-step Azure + Netlify deployment instructions.
- Add Playwright tests for the three mobile behaviors we recently hardened.

Let me know which follow-up you'd like.
